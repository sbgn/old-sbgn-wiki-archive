SBGN being as new as it is, there is a lot of exciting ongoing development taking place. We gather information about activities below. The [Documents/Specifications](/Documents/Specifications "wikilink") page provides links to the current public SBGN specifications.

Working materials relevant to all languages
-------------------------------------------

The development of SBGN languages involves discussing and voting on different issues/features. This requires circulating [background documentation relevant to the votes](/documentation_votes "wikilink").

SBGN languages do not offer currently clean and expressive way of representing topologies and connectivities between components of graphs. This question is relevant at all scales, and solutions are necessary for representing domains, molecular complexes, sub-cellular phenomena, anatomical structures etc.

Various propositions were made, from extending the existing languages to creating a completely new language. [An area of the wiki](/topology "wikilink") is dedicated to this issue.

SBGN Process Description language specification working materials
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The latest draft of SBGN PD Level 1 can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/sbgn/code/HEAD/tree/ProcessDiagram/trunk/Specification/sbgn_PD-level1.pdf). Beware, this is a draft straight from the cradle. *This is not the latest public SBGN PD specification!*

You can comment on the specification for SBGN Process Description language Level 1 through the [sourceforge tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=178553&atid=1082245)

Discussions have started on possible evolutions of [PD for level 2](/PD_development/Level_2 "wikilink").

We welcome discussion on [future developments of the PD language](/PD_development "wikilink").

SBGN Entity Relationship language specification working materials
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The latest draft of SBGN ER Level 1 can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/sbgn/code/HEAD/tree/EntityRelationship/trunk/sbgn_ER-level1.pdf). Beware, this is a draft straight from the cradle. *This is not the latest public SBGN ER specification!*

You can comment on the specification for SBGN Process Description language Level 1 through the [sourceforge tracker](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=178553&atid=1170625)

We welcome discussion on [future developments of the ER language](/ER_development "wikilink").

SBGN Activity Flow specification working materials
--------------------------------------------------

The latest draft of SBGN AF Level 1 can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/sbgn/code/HEAD/tree/ActivityFlow/trunk/sbgn_AF-level1.pdf). Beware, this is a draft straight from the cradle. *This is not the latest public SBGN AF specification!*
