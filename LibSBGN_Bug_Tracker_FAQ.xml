      <text xml:space="preserve">= Who can use the tracker? =

'''Anyone'''[*] with an interest in LibSBGN is encouraged to report technical issues in the bug tracker.

[*] In particular, people taking part in technical discussions on the mailing list (cf. below)

= When exactly should I use the tracker? =

The tracker can be used:
* to raise brand new technical issues, i.e. to report new bugs or request new features
* to keep track of unresolved technical issues initially raised on the mailing list, as a reminder that something needs be done

= What is the relationship between the tracker and the mailing list? =

The tracker is a kind of &quot;To Do&quot; list, to make sure technical issues do not get forgotten after they got raised.&lt;br /&gt;
The tracker is NOT meant to be used as a discussion forum. 

The mailing list is the place to go to discuss important issues in-depth.&lt;br /&gt;
The mailing list is NOT a good reminder of what needs be done.

Ideally:
* every '''unresolved technical issue''' discussed on the mailing list should have a corresponding entry in the bug-tracker.
* every '''major issue''' reported in the tracker should eventually be discussed on the mailing list.

= How should I use the tracker? =

When submitting an issue, please try to stick to the following guidelines:

== Create atomic bug reports ==

Don't mention more than one issue in a single report: a new report should be created for each separate issue. Even for related issues, two separate reports will make it possible to, for example, close one and postpone the other.

== Use precise, descriptive titles ==

Each issue should be reasonably easy to identify when looking at the whole list:
* DON'T: &quot;Issue 1&quot;, &quot;Problem with current xsd&quot;, etc.
* DO: &quot;All logical operators are missing&quot;, &quot;State variables: 3rd notation not supported&quot;, etc.

== Be concise ==

This means reasonably short descriptions (a few sentences at most), and (usually) no comments, as the tracker is not meant for long discussions

== Discuss on the mailing list? ==

* If the issue requires in-depth discussions, and is not actively being discussed in the mailing list (either because it is brand new, or too old), it is worth (re)opening the topic in the mailing list.
* If the issue is minor (e.g. reporting a typo), no need to start a discussion on the mailing list, a bug report is sufficient.

=  When are issues raised in the tracker eventually dealt with? =
Open issues are reviewed regularly: normally once during each monthly online meeting, and at the very least once before every release.

Upon review, issues are usually:
* clarified (if need be)
* targeted to a certain milestone
* assigned to a developer</text>
