      <text xml:space="preserve">==Prior to Departure==

→ You may want to check the weather forecast for Tokyo immediately prior to your departure. It often rains unpredictably in Tokyo, so at least bring a light jacket, shoes that can get wet, and an umbrella.

→ It is important to become familiar with the Airport Limousine Bus service that you will take to get from Narita airport to the hotel. Here is their web site: http://www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/

→ You may wish to obtain whatever kind of power adapter is necessary for you to use your laptop and other electrical devices in Japan. It may be possible to buy converters at the shops around the hotel, but the supply is not guaranteed, nor is it assured they will have the right type for everyone. Japanese electrical current is 50 Hz, 100 V. See http://kropla.com/electric2.htm or http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/GJ/ for information on power and plugs in Japan.

==Upon Arrival at Narita Airport==

→ You will be arriving at either Terminal 1 or Terminal 2 of Narita airport. The web page http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~ito-nori/spot/spot_nrt1.htm provides more information.

→ Once you get through security, customs, and the baggage area, you will exit into the Terminal hallways. Once there, you will probably want to begin by obtaining Japanese currency. You can do this using ATM machines or the currency exchange counters in the hallways. You will be able to pay for most things with a credit card (including the bus tickets), but it is good to have some hard currency anyway.

→ Next, look for the “Airport Limousine Bus”. Here are 2 photos of the counter that you will be looking for:

→ At the Airport Limousine Counter, you need to purchase a ticket to take you to Shiodome. Unless you made separate arrangements, your hotel is the Hotel Villa Fontaine Shiodome. The bus stop you need is the one called “Royal Park Shiodome Tower”. When you are purchasing the ticket, also make sure to ask at what time you should go outside the airport terminal to board the bus. When you pay, make sure to save your receipt. Important note: DO NOT TAKE A TAXI from the airport! It is a 1+ hour drive and the cost of a taxi is prohibitive.

→ When you go outside, you will be looking for a bus that looks somewhat like the one in this picture:

→ The bus ride will take probably around 1 3/4 hours, but the exact time is variable because the bus will make other stops before it reaches your hotel. You will need to get out at the Shiodome stop. The bus will actually make two stops, one on each side of a major road and train crossing at Shiodome. Your stop should be the first one, but make sure to ask. If you get out and you find yourself at the “Royal Park Tower Hotel”, it means you are on the opposite side of where you need to be for the Villa Fontaine, so simply go up to the walkways above the street and cross over to the side with the Villa Fontaine.

→ The Hotel Villa Fontaine is located inside the Shiodome Sumitomo building:

→ The building's main hall and the hotel entrance are pictured here. When you get inside, you need to cross the large open space to the far side, where the actual hotel entrance is located.

→ When you arrive at the hotel, give your name and mention that you are a member of the “SBGN” group. The hotel staff knows the names of everyone expected in the group.</text>
