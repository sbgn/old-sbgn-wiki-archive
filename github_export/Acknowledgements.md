We are deeply indebted to the many funding agencies and organizations that have supported SBGN over the years.

The development of SBGN was mainly supported by a grant from the Japanese [New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)](http://www.nedo.go.jp). The [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST)](http://www.oist.jp), the British [Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/) through a *Japan Partnering Award*, the [European Media Laboratory (EML Research GmbH)](http://www.eml-r.org/), and the [Beckman Institute BNMC at the California Institute of Technology](http://bnmc.caltech.edu) provided additional support for SBGN workshops. The [Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)](http://www.jst.go.jp/) and the *Genome Network Project* of the [Japanese Ministry of Education, Sports, Culture, Science, and Technology (MEXT)](http://www.mext.go.jp/) also supported the development of the gene regulation network aspect of SBGN.
