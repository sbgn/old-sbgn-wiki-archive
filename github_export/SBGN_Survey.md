The SBGN Survey
---------------

The SBGN Editors have developed a survey about SBGN. Our aim is to gauge the levels of SBGN usage: what it is used for, what languages are used and to generally get feedback on what users like, don't like, or think can be improved. The feedback from this survey will help the community shape the future development of SBGN.

We would like the survey to reach as wide as range of life scientists as possible, so after you complete the survey can you help by spreading the word to your colleagues and collaborators? We have created a form email (http://www.sbgn.org/SBGN_Survey\#Form_Email) that you may wish to use when contacting them. Your help is important and appreciated.

The survey should only take approximately 10 minutes to complete and can be found [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/96ZFGCV).

Subject: A Survey of Pathway Diagrams

Body: Dear Colleague,

Could you spend a little time to complete a short survey about Biological Pathway diagrams?

For a number of years now a community of like minded Systems Biologists have been developing a graphical notation that aims to systematically and unambiguously draw biological pathways. Our aim has been to permit the exchange of pathway information graphically without the need for supporting text. We call this standard the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN). You can find out more at <http://www.sbgn.org>.

We would like to understand how widely SBGN is used and whether the notation meets your needs and so we have developed our survey.

It would be of great assistance to us if you could complete the survey by following the link below. It will only take about 10 minutes of your time.

Kind regards,

The SBGN Editorial Board.
