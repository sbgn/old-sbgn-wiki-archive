A process transforms one or several physical entities into one or several others. Examples would be biochemical reactions converting chemicals into others or transport reactions moving chemicals from one compartment to another. In SBGN Process Description language, the use of reactants is represented by the *consumption arc*, a simple arc without specific ends. The generation of products is represented by the *production arc*, an arc ending by a filled arrowhead. In the drawing below, the consumption and production arcs are coloured in red:

The following generic example describes an entity C that stimulates the process consuming an entity A and producing an entity B.

A reaction or a transport can be reversible. In that case, both side of the process are linked to production arcs:
