*by Nicolas Le Nov√®re*

The Nucleic Acid Feature construct in SBGN is meant to represent a fragment of a macromolecule carrying genetic information. A common use for this construct is to represent a gene or a transcript. The macromolecule would be the entire nucleic acid molecule, such as an entire chromatide. The Nucleic acid feature has two round corners, to remind it is carried by a macromolecule, and two right angle corners, to remind it is essentially a unit of information rather than a *bona fide* molecule.

The following example describes the synthesis of a protein from amino-acids, triggered ("necessary stimulated") by mRNA.
