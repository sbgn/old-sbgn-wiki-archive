A complex node represents a biochemical entity composed of other biochemical entities, whether macromolecules, simple chemicals, multimers, or other complexes, linked by non-covalent bounds. The complex construct in SBGN possesses its own symbol, which is a rectangle with cut-corners (an octagonal box with sides of two different lengths). This symbol can be decorated with the symbols of its components. In this case, the label of the complex is optional.
