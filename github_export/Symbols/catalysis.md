*by Nicolas Le Nov√®re*

A *catalysis* is a particular case of [*stimulation*](/Symbols/stimulation "wikilink"), where the effector affects positively the flux of a process represented by the target process. The positive effect on the process is due to the lowering of the activation energy of a reaction. The target extremity of a *catalysis* carries an empty circle.

In SBGN Process Description language, the catalysis of a process is represented by the *catalysis arc*. The target extremity of a *catalysis* carries an empty circle. A *catalysis arc* starts from an *entity pool node* (labelled "EPN" in the figure below, representing for instance a pool of molecules) and ends on a *process node* (labelled "PN" in the figure below, representing for instance a reaction). In the drawing below, the catalysis arc is coloured in red:
