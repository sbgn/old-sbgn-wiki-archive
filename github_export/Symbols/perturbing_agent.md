A perturbing agent is an Entity Pool Node found in PD. This glyph represents external influences carried on a biochemical network. Those influences can be the effect of well-defined physical perturbing agents, such as light pulse or a temperature change. They can also be more complex and not well-defined phenomena, for instance the outcome of a biological process or a mutation. The perturbing agent glyph is represented by a modified hexagon having two opposite concave faces. It is identified by a label and may carry a clone marker. One or more units of information can also be defined.

Units of information use a controlled vocabulary to describe the physical characteristics of a perturbing agent:

| **Name**    | **Label** | **SBOterm** |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Temperature | pc:T      | SBO:0000147 |
| Voltage     | pc:V      | SBO:0000259 |
| pH          | pc:pH     | SBO:0000304 |

The following example shows the transport of sodium chemical Na+ into the cytoplasm of a cell via the sodium channel. The sodium channel is sensitive to the membrane potential: when the membrane is polarized, the sodium channel is closed and when the membrane is depolarized, the sodium channel is opened. In our example, the membrane is depolarized (perturbing agent). This induce the opening of sodium channel and thus the import of sodium Na+ into the cytoplasm.
