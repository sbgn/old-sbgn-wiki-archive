An unit of information for a biological activity in AF illustrates the nature of the entity from which the activity comes from. It is always represented with a biological activity glyph. The unit of information can provide two types of information: the nature of the entity represented by the shape of the unit of information and the name of the entity represented by a label in the unit of information.

There are six types of unit of information that can characterize a biological activity, as described below:

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                           |     |                    |

The following example shows the transcription regulation of the gene GAS by STAT1. We can see that the protein STAT1 (a macromolecule) and the gene GAS (a nucleic acid feature) needs to form a complex in order to activate the transcription of GAS mRNA.
