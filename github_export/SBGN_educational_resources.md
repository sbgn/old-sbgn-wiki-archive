This page contains links to courses partially or exclusively devoted to teaching SBGN to students. It is aimed to help an educator to build a course and select tools to be used during the course.

-   Fall 2012 [Introduction to Systems Biology](http://www.ccam.uchc.edu/mblinov/MEDS-6455-2012-Fall.html) graduate course at [Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling](http://www.ccam.uchc.edu/) ([UCHC](http://www.uchc.edu/)) has a lecture and a set of assignments in SBGN. Tools and techniques taught:
    -   Reading SBGN using Panther and Reactome databases
    -   Drawing SBGN using CellDesigner & SBGN-ED.
    -   Drawing MIM (roughly similar to SBGN-ED) using Pathvisio-MIM.

-   April 2013 Tutorial on [Mathematical Modeling for the Cell Biology Researcher and Educator](http://www.nimbios.org/wordpress-training/cellbiology/schedule/) had couple of lectures mentioning SBGN.

<span class="h-icon-software">SBGN "student-friendly" tools used in course </span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a comprehensive list of SBGN-supporting tools! Only tools friendly enough that have been used in student education are listed here.

-   [PANTHER](http://www.pantherdb.org/pathway/) - has a large collection of pathways beautifully drawn in SBGN-PD. Was used in UCHC ISB course.
-   [CellDesigner](http://www.celldesigner.org/) - used by many biologists (both modelers and non-modelers) to draw SBGN-PD diagrams that can be either converted to a computable model or used for presentations. Was used in UCHC ISB course.
-   [SBGN-ED (Vanted)](http://www.sbgn-ed.org/) - a tool that can be used to draw SBGN-PD, ER and AF. Was used in UCHC ISB course.
