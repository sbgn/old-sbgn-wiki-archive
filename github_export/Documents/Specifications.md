__TOC__ This page provides a summary of the state of the **public specifications**. You can also access [all specifications](/Documents/All_specifications "wikilink"). More details are available elsewhere about the [nomenclature of SBGN](/Nomenclature "wikilink"). All documents and source files are available in the [Subversion repository for SBGN on Sourceforge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbgn).

Process Description language (formerly Process Diagram language)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The SBGN *Process Description* (PD) language shows the temporal courses of biochemical interactions in a network. It can be used to show all the molecular interactions taking place in a network of biochemical entities, with the same entity appearing multiple times in the same diagram.

The public specification for SBGN Process Description language Level 1 Version 1.3 can be accessed through Nature Precedings: [<doi:10.1038/npre.2011.3721.4>](http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3721/version/4).

For end-users more than software developers a [user manual](/media:Sbgn_PD-level1-user-public.pdf "wikilink") is also available.

To report an error or to comment on the SBGN Process Description specification, please use the [dedicated PD L1 tracker](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=178553&atid=1082245)

Entity Relationship language
----------------------------

The SBGN *Entity Relationship* (ER) language allows you to see all the relationships in which a given entity participates, regardless of the temporal aspects. Relationships can be seen as rules describing the influences of entities nodes on other relationships.

The public specification for SBGN Entity Relationship language Level 1 Version 2.0 can be accessed through Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics: [<doi:10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-264>](https://sourceforge.net/p/sbgn/code/HEAD/tree/EntityRelationship/tags/Level1-Version2/sbgn_ER-level1.pdf?format=raw).

To report an error or to comment on the SBGN Entity Relationship specification, please use the [dedicated ER L1 tracker](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=178553&atid=1170625)

Activity Flow language
----------------------

The SBGN *Activity Flow* (AF) language depicts the flow of information between biochemical entities in a network. It omits information about the state transitions of entities and is particularly convenient for representing the effects of perturbations, whether genetic or environmental in nature.

The public specification for SBGN Activity Flow language Level 1 Version 1.2 can be accessed through Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics: \[ <doi:10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-265>\]

To report an error or to comment on the SBGN Activity specification, please use the [dedicated AF L1 tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=178553&atid=1175366).
