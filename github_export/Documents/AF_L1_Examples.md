Repressilator
-------------

The repressilator is a circular system of three genes which products sequentially inhibit the expression of the next gene. Both the model and its in vitro realization were published by Michael Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in 2000, in a publication that is seen as one of the milestones in the birth of Synthetic Biology.

EGFR signaling
--------------

This is a representation in AF of the signaling pathways triggered by EGF binding on its receptor. The original information came from [STKE](http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/stkecm;CMP_14987), and a first version of the image was published in [the initial SBGN publication](http://identifiers.org/pubmed/19668183).
